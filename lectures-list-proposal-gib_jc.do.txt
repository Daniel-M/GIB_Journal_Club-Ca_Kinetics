======= Motivation =======

To bring a general view of the state of the art on Calcium ion kinetics on muscle physiology
I suggest the set of lectures presented in this document. The lectures are aimed to present a general view of skeletal muscle kinetcis and the experimental methods for i*in-vivo* Calcium imaging, then read about the plausibility of develop mathematical models for biochemical reactions and complex biological systems. The last couple of readings present two different mathematical models for simulate Calcium kinetics inside muscle fibers of frog.


======= Paper list =======

Here are two lists, a *main list* and *complementary readings* list. The main list is presented in the suggested order and constitute the main core of the readings. The complementary list complement papers on the main list.
